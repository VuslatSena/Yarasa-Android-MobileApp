# Samsung Innovation Campus Final Project - Mobile Side

Enhancing the hard-of-hearing driving experience was set as the goal of this project. In addition, it is expected that the rate of driving license for people with hearing loss will increase by decreasing the traffic accident rate of those with hearing loss. All of these are expected to be achieved by visually simulating the hearing ability.
People with hearing loss can be very disadvantaged when it comes to activities that require excellent cooperation of different senses, such as driving. In this project, it is planned to reduce these disadvantages by using basic IoT elements and collaborating with deep learning with IoT media software.
